    In August 2007 I decided to take my frustration with San Francisco Muni light-rail public by
    creating t-shirts parodying the system. My shirts quickly came under fire from the New York MTA (yes, New York!)
    resulting in t-shirt printer CafePress.com halted production of my products. Since then my story has been picked up
    by blogs, newsgroups, discussion boards, fellow targets of the NYMTA, and even local newspapers. Read all about it!
